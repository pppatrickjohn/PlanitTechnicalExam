# c. Validating unsuccessful login of unregistered customer.
# d. Validating successful item removal
# e. Validating successful empty cart functionality


#2. Jupiter Toys is expected to grow and expand its offering into books, tech, and modern art. We are expecting the of tests will grow to a very large number.
#What approaches could you used to reduce overall execution time?
#How will your framework cater for this?
# Answer : Make a framework where you can choose certain Test Cases you want to execute making sure key functionalities are still being covered. Identifying as well certain types of automation test like regression, sanity, etc. containing selected Test Cases and putting them in a suite can control the execution time. Doing a parallel execution will also help using headless. The framework which I created already cover these and can still be improved using new programming technologies.


#3. Describe when to use a BDD approach to automation and when NOT to use BDD 
# Answer : BDD Test Automation approach is used when everyone is needed to be involved to share knowledge on what should be tested. It is also suggested to be used in large scale project where all stakeholders can participate as it doesn't require technical skills. But it is not suggested in small scale projects as maintaining it will use alot of time especially when it comes to retrofitting it. And it also requires alot of time of developing automation code.
